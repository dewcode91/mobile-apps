**Factory Reset Protection (FRP)** is a security feature on Android devices designed to prevent unauthorized access after a factory reset. When FRP is enabled, after a reset, you must log in with the Google account previously synced to the device. This helps deter device theft and unauthorized use.

### How is FRP Bypassed? (For Educational Awareness)

> **Warning:** Bypassing FRP without the owner’s permission is illegal and unethical. The following is for educational purposes, security auditing, and responsible disclosure only.

#### Common FRP Bypass Methods

1. **Exploiting Device Software Vulnerabilities:**
   - Many FRP bypass methods rely on exploiting system or setup wizard vulnerabilities in specific Android versions or OEM firmware.
   - Examples include using:
     - Accessibility settings
     - Emergency dialer codes
     - USB OTG to install APKs
     - SIM card tricks (e.g., triggering a call or message)

2. **Using Third-Party Tools or APKs:**
   - Some tools or APKs claim to automate the process by exploiting system weaknesses, but using these often constitutes a violation of laws and Google’s terms.

3. **Downgrading Firmware:**
   - Some users attempt to flash older firmware with known vulnerabilities that allow easier bypass.

5. **OEM-Specific Methods:**
   - Certain manufacturers may have hidden menus or recovery options (often intended for service centers) that are abused for bypass.

#### Why does this happen?
- **Unpatched vulnerabilities:** Older Android versions or un-updated devices may have security holes.
- **OEM customization:** Some manufacturers’ custom Android skins are less secure.
- **User error:** Device owners sometimes unknowingly disable security.

#### How to Prevent FRP Bypass

- Keep your device updated to the latest firmware.
- Don’t share your Google account or credentials.
- Never use third-party tools claiming to unlock FRP for you.
- Only purchase devices from trusted sources.
