# Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) Checklist

The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) provides a comprehensive checklist for assessing the security of mobile applications. Below is a condensed checklist based on MSTGâ€™s requirements, suitable for Android and iOS apps.

---

## 1. Architecture, Design, and Threat Modeling
- [ ] Understand app architecture and data flow.
- [ ] Identify potential attack surfaces and threat agents.
- [ ] Document security controls and trust boundaries.

---

## 2. Data Storage and Privacy (MSTG-STORAGE)
- [ ] Sensitive data is not stored in insecure locations (e.g., external storage).
- [ ] No sensitive information is cached unnecessarily.
- [ ] Data is encrypted using strong algorithms (AES-256, etc.).
- [ ] Keychain/Keystore is used properly for secrets.
- [ ] App prevents data leaks via logs, screenshots, backups.

---

## 3. Cryptography (MSTG-CRYPTO)
- [ ] Cryptographic algorithms are up-to-date and correctly implemented.
- [ ] Keys are managed securely (generation, storage, rotation).
- [ ] No hardcoded cryptographic keys or credentials.
- [ ] Randomness is generated using secure APIs.

---

## 4. Authentication and Session Management (MSTG-AUTH)
- [ ] Strong authentication for users and devices.
- [ ] Sessions are securely managed and terminated.
- [ ] Tokens are stored securely and transmitted over TLS.
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials.

---

## 5. Network Communication (MSTG-NETWORK)
- [ ] All network traffic uses TLS.
- [ ] Certificate validation is enforced (including pinning if required).
- [ ] No sensitive data sent via unencrypted protocols.
- [ ] WebViews are configured securely (disable JS, file access as needed).

---

## 6. Platform Interaction (MSTG-PLATFORM)
- [ ] App permissions are minimal and justified.
- [ ] No misuse of inter-process communication (IPC).
- [ ] Secure use of intents, broadcast receivers, and deep links.
- [ ] App sandboxing and isolation are enforced.

---

## 7. Code Quality and Exploit Mitigation (MSTG-CODE)
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- [ ] Input validation and output encoding are implemented.
- [ ] Error handling avoids information leaks.
- [ ] Debugging code and logs are removed from production builds.

---

## 8. Resilience Against Reverse Engineering and Tampering (MSTG-RESILIENCE)
- [ ] Code obfuscation is implemented.
- [ ] Root/jailbreak detection is present (if required).
- [ ] Integrity checks detect modification/tampering.
- [ ] Anti-debugging measures are in place.

---

## 9. Security Testing and Updates (MSTG-TESTING)
- [ ] Automated security tests are part of CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Regular manual penetration testing is performed.
- [ ] Vulnerability management and patching processes are defined.

**Tip:** Use this checklist to guide development, review, and penetration testing of mobile apps. Adapt and expand as necessary for your specific threat model and regulatory requirements.
